# Create an Account {#createAccount}

Each researcher involved in screening or data extraction in your systematic review project will have to create a free SyRF account.

Creating an account allows us to keep your data secure and allows the administrator of each project to control who has access to the project data. Read our Data Management and Sharing Policy here.
