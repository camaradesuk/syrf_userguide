# Create an Account {#createAccount}

Each researcher involved in screening or data extraction in your systematic review project will have to create a free SyRF account. Accounts can be set up using your email address or Google Account and you will receive an email to complete your registration.

Creating an account allows us to keep your data secure and allows the administrator of each project to control who has access to the project data. Read our Data Management and Sharing Policy here.

I donâ€™t see an email in my inbox from SyRF

Once you have created an account and logged in you can access public projects or create a new project via the Projects tab in SyRF.
