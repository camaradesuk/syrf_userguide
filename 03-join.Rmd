# Join a Project {#join}

The Projects tab in SyRF will show all the projects you are a member of, as well as all public projects. 

To join a project, you will need to click ‘Request to join’ on the project’s homepage. In the current version of SyRF, all users who request to join a project will be automatically assigned access and the Reviewer role in the project.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/Fig_Request_to_join.png")
```


If you do not wish other users to join your project, it is best to set your project to Private.
