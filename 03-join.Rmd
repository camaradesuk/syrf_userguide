# Join a Project {#join}

When logged in you should be able to see the projects you are a member of in the 'My Projects' tab, as well as all public projects, by clicking ‘Public projects’.

To join a project, you will need to click ‘Request to join’ on the project’s homepage.

The administrator of the project will then need to grant you permission to access different stages of the project.
