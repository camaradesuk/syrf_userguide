# Registration {#registration}

When you start a review, register as a user to access the SyRF screening and data extraction application. All review authors will need to register independently and can be added to a project by the project administrator. Registering helps us keep your data secure and allows the project administrator to control who has access to the project data at different stages of the review. Read our Data Management and Sharing Policy here.
