## Project Overview 
When in Project Overview you can expand the description of each stage to see what progress has been made in screening and annotation of that specific stage.

## Project details
You can see an overview of the project on the Project Details page. 

In the centre of the page, you will see a screening stage with the inclusion and exclusion criteria that were added by the Project Administrator during project creation. Click the 'Review' button to enter a stage. If you are a Project Administrator, you will be able to add new stages there too. 

On the right hand side of the Project Overview page you can see:

* Contact - the contact email of the project administrator
* Protocol url - a link to where the systematic review protocol has been published
* Keywords - any keywords assigned to the project
* Systematic searches - details of studies added to the project
* Project visibility - either public or private
* Creation date - the date the project was made
* Members - a list of members on the project

Project Details can be edited by clicking on the cog icons next to each heading.

## Studies
You can see the details of all the studies you have uploaded to SyRF in the studies tab. To learn how to upload studies or systematic searches, please go to [Section 7](https://camaradesuk.github.io/syrf_userguide/systematicSearch.html).

## Stages
You can start screening or annotating in a stage by clicking on the stage name  (on the left-hand side navigation pane) and then 'Review'. Note that if the Project Administrator has not uploaded any systematic searches, you will not be able to under a stage.
