# Annotation Questions {#annotation}

## Define annotation questions
As part of the data abstraction process you can annotate studies within SyRF by specifying what question you want your reviewers to answer about each publication in your project.
In order to do this go to the ‘Design Annotation Questions’ button on the project overview page.

Questions may be nested to allow for hierarchy of conditional information entry (i.e. questions can become active, depending on answers to other questions).
Annotation questions are entered into the following categories:

## Study Level Questions 
Enter any question that is relevant to the overall study. 

e.g. Do the authors refer to a protocol?
(Yes or No checkbox)

## Disease Model Induction questions
### Control Question
Define questions that are specific to the Model control

e.g. Do the control animals receive Sham surgery?
(Yes or No checkbox)

### Non-Control Question
Define questions that are specific to the Model

e.g. What type of surgery was done to induce the model?
(Dropdown list with defined options)

### Both
Define questions that are relevant to both Model control and Model animals

e.g. What anaesthetic is used for both the model and sham surgery?
(Dropdown list with defined options)

## Treatment questions
### Control Question
Define questions that are specific to the Treatment control

e.g. What is the vehicle given to the control animals? 
(Dropdown list with defined options)

### Non-Control Question
Define questions that are specific to the Treatment group

e.g. Specify the dose of treatment drug given in mg/kg
(Integer input field)

### Both
Define questions that are relevant to both Treatment control and Treatment animals

e.g. What route of drug or vehicle administration is used in the experiment?
(Dropdown list with defined options)

## Outcome assessment questions
Define questions relevant to each outcome assessment procedure in the study.

e.g. What is the behavioural test used to measure outcome?
(Dropdown list with defined options)

## Cohort Level Questions
Define questions relevant to each cohort procedure in the study. 

e.g. What is the sex of the animals included in the cohort?
(Dropdown list with options males, females, both, unknown)

I have cohorts with comorbidities and I'm not clear on how to differentiate between them.

## Experiment questions
Define questions relevant to each experimental procedure in the study

e.g. Was there a habituation period?
(Yes or No checkbox)

## Nesting Questions
For each question you can choose to add related questions, if you want to get answers to additional questions, which are conditional on the answer to the previous question.

e.g. “What is the model type?”
(Drop down list with option of: Pharmacological or Surgical)

If Pharmacological is selected we could add a related question by selecting “Add Pharmacological Related”, which you will then be able to see nested under your previous question.

e.g. “What is the drug given?”
(Drop down list with options of different drugs)

You could then further subset this question, by clicking on it and selecting ‘Add Related’ and asking for each drug selected: “What is the dose and route of delivery?”
If Surgical is selected then we may ask the related questions: “What was the anaesthetic used?” or “What was the site of lesion?”
