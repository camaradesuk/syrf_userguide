# SyRF user Roles {#roles}

There are two user roles in SyRF: Project Administrator (admin) and Reviewer. These roles are project specific - you may be a Project Administrator in some of your projects and a Reviewer in others.

Project Administrators can edit projects and accept new users who request to join their project. Reviewers are users who have been granted access to a project by a Project Administrator, and can screen or annotate studies in the project.

## Changing a user role
When users join a project, they will automatically be assigned the Reviewer role.

Only Project Administrators can change user roles. In the list of members in your project, click the pencil icons next to a users name to change their role in your project.

If you are assigned a Reviewer role and think you should be a Project Administrator instead, please contact one of the other Project Administrators on the project to change this for you.
