# Join a Project {#join}

When logged in you should be able to see the projects you are a member of in the 'My Projects' tab, as well as all public projects, by clicking ‘Public projects’.

To join a project, you will need to click ‘Request to join’ on the project’s homepage.

The administrator of the project will then need to grant you permission to access different stages of the project.

## Joining projects that aren't public
If one of your colleagues has asked to you join their SyRF project, but they project isn't set to public, ask them to send you the URL to the homepage of the project they want you to join and you will have the option to 'Request to join' there.
