When logged in you should be able to see Projects you are a member of and also all other public projects, by clicking ‘Public projects’.

To collaborate on a project, you will need to click ‘Register to join’ on the project’s homepage.

The administrator of the project will then need to grant you permission to access different stages of the project.
