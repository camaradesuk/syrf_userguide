Users can request to join and can be assigned roles such as administration (i.e. have editing rights to the design of the project), screening, data annotation, or data extraction roles. 2.1.2 Private project A project that is not visible to other SyRF users unless they have requested and have been granted permission to join the project. 2.2 Protocol Structured description of what you set out to do in your systematic review and meta-analysis, we recommend that this is published or shared publicly with PROSPERO. 2.3 Screen Include or exclude publications identified in your systematic search based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria defined in your protocol. Described in further detail in section 5. 2.4 Annotation 1 You may want to annotate studies by labelling or extracting relevant information from them. This stage of a project is fairly flexible and therefore you can define your own annotation questions for your project. Annotation questions should address all questions you want to ask as specified in your protocol. You can choose at which stage of the project you want to answer specific annotation questions. This is described in further detail in section 6. 2.5 Data extraction Where you extract data from graphs or tables in the form of means/medians and corresponding error. 2.6 Experiment Experiment refers to any grouping of cohorts where an experiment is carried out at the same time and any of them can be compared with each other. 2.7 Cohort Refers to a group of animals - same species, strain, source, co-morbidities (if applicable) - which all receive the same procedure and treatments and can be compared to other cohorts. So an experiment may involve the following cohorts: Treatment, Sham and Control; or Control, Treatment 1 and Treatment 2. Whereby the following comparisons may be made: e.g. Cohort 1 = Disease Model Cohort 2 = Disease Model + Comorbidity Cohort 3 = Sham or Disease Model Control Cohort 4 = Disease Model + Treatment (Low Dose) Cohort 5 = Disease Model + Treatment (High Dose) Cohort 6 = Disease Model + Treatment Control (vehicle) "],["registration.html", "Section 3 Registration 3.1 If you are a first time user 3.2 Logging in if you already have an account", " Section 3 Registration When you start a review, register as a user to access the SyRF screening and data extraction application. All review authors will need to register independently and can be added to a project by the project administrator. Registering helps us keep your data secure and allows the project administrator to control who has access to the project data at different stages of the review.

Clicking Next will then prompt you to check the details of the upload before you begin the upload. &lt;&lt; Insert Image &gt;&gt; Please note, at current we support spreadsheets (i.e. csv/tsv - see below) or XML libraries directly exported from EndNote.

You can do this by saving your study details in a csv or tsv file and selecting the appropriate upload option when uploading your search. Please check here for the format your file needs to be in before upload. &lt;&lt; Insert Image &gt;&gt; Next, if you want to add screening decisions, make sure to have Toggle to include screening decisions with upload on and fill out the appropriate information for SyRF to be able to attribute data correctly. &lt;&lt; Insert Image &gt;&gt; Please note, if you need to delete a systematic search from your SyRF project refresh the browser first. 6.2 If you require full-text for your studies If you require full-text to be available at any stage of your project, it is important that you have already retrieved these before uploading your search file. In the systematic search file that you upload (csv/tsv spreadsheet or XML from Endnote) make sure the column PDF Relative Path contains relative path links (i.e. relative to the root of the folder you send to us) to your PDFs for each record. &lt;&lt; Insert Image &gt;&gt; You will then need to contact us with the name of your project and share the folder containing your PDFs via Google Drive or similar.

You may need to authenticate your log in details for your institution. There is a limit of searching for 250 per go but it is worth going through this step multiple times if necessary as it is the quickest way of retreiving PDFs at present. Endnote will download, save and name the PDFs. These can then be found in your Endnote Data File in a folder named PDF. If you download your PDFs in this way, it is advisable to keep the PDF names and links specified by EndNote so that the links get matched to the appropriate record. &lt;&lt; Insert Link to FAQ &gt;&gt; I am performing a two-stage screening process and need to add PDFs only for my included studies for full-text screening 6.3 View project studies and study details You can now view project studies by clicking on the View Project Studies button.

Currently most projects are set to have a minimum number of 2 screeners, with a project agreement ratio of 0.333 (Information specified on your project home page, under Screening Details). &lt;&lt; Insert Image &gt;&gt; This means that publications are marked as Included, Excluded or Insufficiently screened, whereby you need at least 2 screeners for each study to have agreed on their decision (both said include or exclude). A study will continuously be offered up for screening to other reviewers until this threshold has been met, and two reviewers have given a publication the same decision. If this threshold has not been met, then this will be marked as Insufficiently screened and offered up to the next reviewer. If you would like different criteria for sufficient screening, please contact us and dont forget to include your project name. &lt;&lt; Insert Link to FAQ &gt;&gt; My project only has two screeners, how can I see screening decisions?
